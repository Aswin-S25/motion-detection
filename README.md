# align_ai

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Align AI is a Android and IOS fitness application that utilizes Pose Estimation, a machine learning model that generates the pose of a person by estimating spatial locations and key body parts.

The user will select an exercise they want to do, and the App will run Pose Estimation on them while they do the workout to see if their body is aligned and ensure that they are doing the exercise correctly.
